As a hobby, Leonie is a great advocate in journaling, and can often be found creating new planners. She continuously learns new instruments and is currently learning drumkit and acoustic guitar. If the time is just right, you might catch her with her nose in a good book, or trying to get through her never-ending Netflix watchlist.
