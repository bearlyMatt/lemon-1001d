      When life gives you lemons... *I don't really know to be honest!* So

      This is the "about" excerpt. It can be used to provide a paragraph about
      yourself that people can read on the homepage to get a sense of who you
      are. There also exists a dedicated about page where you can write more
      about yourself for those who are interested.
