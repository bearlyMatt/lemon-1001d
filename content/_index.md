      When life gives you lemons... *I don't really know to be honest!* So
      that's where this site comes in. It's niche and broad in equal measures,
      but follow me as I talk about books, wellbeing, travel and general life!

      Leonie is the best person in the whole world (according to her S/O). She's
      a Bachelor of Music and is currently working her way to a PGDE in
      Secondary Music teaching. She's spent over 8 years in retail and to be
      frank, is done with it - it's not as glamourous as it may (or may not)
      seem. She is the beloved cat-mother of two delightful felines, and lives
      in Scotland with her significant other - a website's worth of material in
      of itself.
